Yes! Unlike many of our competitors, we do not charge you anything to forward your incoming text messages to your email address. However, forwarding to mobile phone is deducted from your quota.

= Can I send a single text message? =

Yes. Instead of selecting a group of contacts, select a single subscriber when you compose your message.

= How many characters may I include in a text message? =

SMS – 160

MMS – 1,600

= Why is my keyword not available? =

A keyword may not be available because some other subscriber has already registered the keyword. Keywords are reserved on a first come first serve basis. WeText can check to see if the account that registered the keyword is an active account upon request.  If another subscriber registered your desired keyword WeText Support can free the keyword for your business use if the previous account is inactive.

= What is a plugin? =

WeText offers more than just text messaging services. Our plugins allow customers to embed subscription, ticketing, merchandise sales, voting/polling and fundraising functionality into their websites.

= How do I change my keyword? =

It’s easiest to create a new account with the desired keyword rather than changing the keyword for the existing account. Billing info and Contacts can be copied over upon request. Please contact our support if you must change your keyword.

= Can I receive MMS messages in my WeText Account? =

Yes, you can. At present your WeText account can display the incoming the text portion of an MMS message. Attached videos and images are filtered for security purposes.

= Can my message be in another language? =

Yes, however, the platform will only support standard alpha and numeric characters. Any accents, symbols, emoticons/emojis or other characters will not be supported. A future version of WeText will support any language supported by unicode character set.

= What is the advantage of using text messaging? =

Text messages are a brief, effective, inexpensive means of communication. Most people carry their cell phones with them wherever they go. Text messaging is currently the most widely used app on all cell phones.  95% of all text messages are viewed within the first 10 minutes of receipt.  This is an astounding number when compared with the open rate of email marketing (18-28%) or Social Media posting at 3%.  Many studies have been done to determine how individuals would like to communicate with businesses and the number one answer was via text and by a wide margin among the desirable Millennial demographic.

= Can I use my WeText account to send bulk text messages? =

Yes! That is exactly what your WeText account is for. We allow you to create and sort your contacts into lists in order to send bulk messages with the click of a button. The main benefit here is that none of your contacts will see each other in a message string like you see when you do group messaging via your cell contact list.  Another big benefit is that if someone responds to your message it will only go to you.

= Can I receive replies to the text messages that I send? =

Yes. They will be delivered to your WeText account. If you’d like, you can choose to forward your replies to your cell phone or your email address.

= How long does it take to deliver a text message? =

Text messages are usually delivered to mobile phones within a few seconds to a few minutes. On rare occasions due to third party cell providers and their network traffic there may be small delays.

= Do I pay for text messages that my recipients do not receive? =

Yes. Whenever a message leaves our system you will be charged for one message.  So if you are sending 1 message to 100 people you will be charged for 100 messages.

= How many messages do you charge to send an MMS? =

Whether you’re sending an SMS or MMS message, we charge you the same for each…just one!

= What are the requirements if I am attaching a picture, video or audio to my message? =

As long as it’s under 1 GB, there are no other requirements. Whenever you send any type of an attachment through our platform it will automatically go through a conversion process that is seamless when used.

= What is a keyword? =

A keyword is a unique word or phrase that people can use to communicate with you via texting to a short code.  This word should be synonymous with either your business name or product that you are selling.  

= How do keywords work? =

The goal of using a keyword text messaging system is to build a mobile database. Your friends and customers can send a message containing your keyword to 48421 to join. Our system will automatically respond to them, with a unique message confirming that they have joined ("opted-in" to) your SMS/MMS system.

= Can I have any keyword I want? Are there any limitations? =

As long as the keyword you want is available, you can register it through your account. You can use any combination of letters and numbers. Remember to keep the keyword as short as possible so as not to confuse your customers.

= Are keywords case-sensitive? =

No, but they are character sensitive. Your keyword must be one word. It can be two words but the space between must be removed.

= Can I have more than one keyword? =

Yes. This feature requires a non standard configuration. Please contact our support to learn how to configure your account for multiple keywords. A future version of WeText will support unlimited keywords from one user account.

= Are there rules for how I can promote my keyword online or in print? =

According to carrier guidelines you must include the following information:

That message and data rates may apply
The frequency (e.g., max 2 messages per week)
Opt-out instructions (e.g., To unsubscribe, text STOP {KEYWORD} to 48421)

= What is a Short Code? =

Short codes have been around for a number of years and have grown in popularity with the advent of smartphones.  The code can be either 5 or 6 digits and it enables end users to easily communicate with businesses, charities and public figures.  They are traditionally easy to remember and work across all mobile networks.

= Where is my data stored? How do you protect my data? =

When you create a WeText account, we store your information on our secure database server. No one has access to your database or your personal information. If you would like to share the data in your account with someone else, you may choose to provide them with your login information.

Our database server is co-located at a data center that is secured via multiple perimeter access systems and fire-proof heavy-duty doors. The data center is equipped with 24x7x365 live video surveillance and multiple level independent fire-suppression systems. The data center is staffed 24x7x365.

= Who owns my data? =

The database of users is solely your property.  You are simply housing it within our platform to enable you to communicate easily with your customers.

= How long does it take to get started? =

You could literally be up and running within a matter of minutes.

= Do I need to possess any technical knowledge/skills? =

WeText is designed for all levels of technical knowledge and skills.  At the same time there is a tremendous amount of depth to the product that will help you to market to and understand your customers over the long term.  WeText is always available to help if you run into issues and or questions regarding the platform.  Simply email us at support@wetext.co and we are there for you.

= What do I need to use WeText? =

WeText can be accessed from any internet enabled device as well as through any browser that you are using.  

= What is a username? =

When you sign up for either a WeText trial account or go directly to a purchased account our system will generate a unique username for you.  Once you have completed the registration process your account credentials will be automatically emailed to you.

= Where Does WeText Work? =

WeText is a global organization.. Our US short code is 48421 and our international code is +12342447283 (+1234-BIG-SAVE)

= Will you send advertisements via text message to my contacts? =

As the database is of your customers they will never receive messages directly from us or any other customers of WeText.

= Is my list of contacts secure? How do you protect my privacy? =

Your contacts are kept in strict confidentiality. We do not share, rent, or sell the contacts belonging to our clients with any third parties. Your database and your personal information that you enter in your account belongs to you, and you alone.

= Why do you ask me for my phone number when I register? =

When you go through the registration process we use a multi tiered security protocol to enable us to confirm that you are actually the user requesting to open an account.  During the process you will receive a confirmation code that you will need to input during the account registration.  Without this code you will be unable to actually open the account.

= Can I collect numbers on my website? =

Yes. You can use your Campaign URL to create a signup widget that you can place on your website, Facebook page, and email templates.

= How do I upload my contacts? =

Currently imports of your database are only available through our support team. The file that you send over to us to import must either be in an excel or .csv format.  Importing is only available to paid accounts.

= Can I manually add numbers to my database? =

Any text messaging system is ruled under the guidelines set forth by the FCC.  All systems are supposed to be opt in only.

= What types of files can I send? =

Using WeText’s MMS feature, you’re able to send image, video, and audio files up to 1GB.

I can’t click on the link in the text message.

If you have an iPhone, you may have run into this issue due to a previous Apple system update. There are a few fixes you can try yourself:

Exit out of the text message and then open it up again. The link should now appear blue and you should be able to click on it.
If the above does not work, try holding down on the text message for a few seconds. You should feel the text "pop" and you should be able to see the link in blue.
If neither of the two above do not work, edit the link in the Back Office by adding in "www."
If you still have issues after trying all of the above, please contact us and we will do our best to help you find another way. We would also suggest sending feedback to Apple.

= Can I see who has opened/read their message? =

No, texting technology does not provide a way to determine when a subscriber actually opens or reads a message you send them. We do not have access to that information.

= Do opt-in messages count towards my message limit? =

Yes.  All communication from any number to your system will count toward your message limit.

= My subscriber list isn’t building as fast as I thought it would. Am I doing something wrong? =

Building your database takes time and we advise you to have a promotion strategy in place with clear instructions on how to opt-in (texting your keyword to 48421). As there are many ways to promote your text campaign and encourage sign-ups, here are a few ideas to get you started:

Social Media
Email Blasts
Website Integration
Word of Mouth
Printed Materials

= Can I reserve a keyword even if I am not ready to move forward with a text message campaign? =

Yes! We can reserve your keyword for you for an entire year for $19.99. If you already have one in mind, you can reserve it now here: https://wetext.co/api/signups.php?id=1048

= How do subscribers opt-out? =

You subscribers would simply need to text STOP to 48421 and it would remove them from any and all lists they may be subscribed to. To opt-out of one account only, they would text STOP {KEYWORD} to 48421.

= I copied and pasted a text message and it does not appear correctly on a cell phone. =

Certain characters are rendered differently on different mobile phones. Any character copied from an outside source can appear incorrectly. If you are copying and pasting from any outside source, retype it manually, because there can be hidden characters. You can test this by sending the message to your own phone.

= How do I know all messages went out successfully? Why did some of my contacts not receive a text I sent them? Why was there a delay in receiving messages? Is is possible that my message was blocked? How can I control message delivery times? =

WeText delivery rates to the wireless carriers are virtually 100%. However, that does not guarantee that all recipients will receive the message or receive it at the same time. This has to do with how the texting technology works. Sending an SMS/MMS message via WeText is virtually the same as sending it from your cell phone. Following scenarios may occur when you send an SMS/MMS from your cell phone:

In most cases, your message will be received by the recipients within 4 seconds
Sometimes there is a delay because recipient’s wireless carrier is experiencing high volume, infrastructure or other issues
There may be a delay if the recipient’s cell phone is roming. Most texting apps are configured to not download MMS (or even SMS) while roming
There may be a delay if the recipient’s cell phone has poor signal
There may be a delay if the recipient’s cell phone is using a non-standard message protocol (e.g. WiFi calling/Texting)
Sometimes your message will be caught by erroneous spam filters and will not make it to the recipient. Just like your email spam filters, wireless carriers also have spam filters. Sometimes wireless carriers make a mistake with a filter and block messages incorrectly. For example, some carriers incorrectly blocked messages with word "Uber" or "Click <link>" or even Google short URLs (goo.gl). Lucky for us, most of these errors are corrected over time
The recipient may not receive your message if they are using a pre-paid cell phone
The recipient may not receive your message if they are not using a true wireless carrier (e.g. Google-Fi)
The recipient may not receive your message if they are using a non-standard messaging app (e.g. Google Voice)
Since WeText behaves the same as your cell phone, it also inherits the same characteristics listed above. Good news is that these issues are rare. In most cases, your message will be delivered almost instantly and more importantly, it will be opened by the recipient within a few seconds of being received.

If you have any other questions about message delivery, please contact support@wetext.co.
